    <h3>What is Ice cream</h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as 
            a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and
             is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an 
             alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla,
             or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can
             also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid
            nitrogen together.
