    <h3>What is Ice cream</h3>
        <p>
            Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as 
            a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and
             is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an 
             alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla,
             or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can
             also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid
            nitrogen together.
        </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>white sugar</li>
        <li>heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir sugar, cream, and milk into a saucepan over low heat
             until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until mix is hot and
              a small ring of foam appears around the edge.
            </li>
        <li>
            Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as 
            a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill
             mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)
            </li>
        <li>
            Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, 
            turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's
             directions, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
        <li>
            When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or
             place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream 
             and place in freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.
            </li>
