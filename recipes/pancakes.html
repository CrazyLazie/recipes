        <h3>What are pancakes</h3>
            <p>
                A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat 
                cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based 
                batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked 
                on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often 
                frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread. 
                Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably 
                the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in 
                prehistoric societies.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, 
                    salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in 
                    the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over 
                    medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
                    using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both 
                    sides and serve hot.
